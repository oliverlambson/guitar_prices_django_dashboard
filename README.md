# Guitar prices: web-dashboard to understand brand's pricing strategies

A web dashboard to visualise scraped data about the market prices of guitars (separated by brand, bub-brand, model range, etc.). 

Allows non-technical users to easily interact with the data through a web-based dashboard. This can be used to gain insights into the overlap between, and differences in, the "big" guitar brands' pricing strategies for their various sub-brands and product lines.

See [the web-scraping project](https://github.com/oliverlambson/guitar_prices_web_scraping) where the data was collected.

*Tools:* Django; C3.js; Pandas.
